    Featuring four wheel-drive mecanum wheels which enable movement in any direction in addition to accelerated rotation, this robot was
    designed for agility and control. Totes were lifted via ropes and a pulley attached to

    RECYCLE RUSH is a recycling-themed game designed for the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It is played by two Alliances of three
    Teams each. Alliances compete simultaneously to score points by stacking Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling
    Containers, and properly disposing of Litter, represented by pool noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of the
    game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.
    <br /><br />
    The 27 ft. by 54 ft. playing Field is bisected by a small Step which may not be climbed on or crossed by Robots. Thus each Alliance competes
    on their respective 26 ft. by 27 ft. side of the Field.
    <br /><br />
    Each RECYCLE RUSH Match begins with a 15-second Autonomous Period in which Robots operate independently of their drivers. During this
    period, Robots attempt to move themselves, their Yellow Totes, and their Recycling Containers into the area between the scoring platforms,
    called the Auto Zone. Additional points are awarded if the Yellow Totes are arranged in a single stack. Points for this period are shown in Table
    1-1.

  challenge: >
    Aerial Assist is played by two competing Alliances of three robots each on a flat 25’ x 54’ foot field, straddled by a 
    truss suspended just over five feet above the floor. The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during 
    a two (2)-minute and 30-second match. The more Alliances score their ball in their goals, and the more they work together
     to do it, the more points their Alliance receives.
    <br /><br />
    The match begins with one 10-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate without the control of a driver.
    Each robot may begin with a ball and attempt to score it in a goal. Alliances earn bonus points for scoring balls in this mode.
    Additionally, each high/low pair of goals will be designated “hot” for five seconds, but the order of which side is first 
    is randomized. For each ball scored in a “hot” goal, the Alliance earns additional bonus points.
    <br /><br />
    For the rest of the match, drivers remotely control robots from behind a protective wall. Once all balls 
    in autonomous are scored, only one ball is re-entered in to play, and the Alliances must cycle a single ball as many times as
    possible for the remainder of the match. With the single ball, they try to maximize their points earned by throwing balls 
    over the truss, catching balls launched over the truss, and scoring in the high and low goals on the far side of the field.
    Alliances receive large bonuses for “assists,” which are earned for each robot that has possession of the ball in a zone as
    the ball moves down the field. Read More

    ULTIMATE ASCENT is played by two competing alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 ft field. Each alliance consists of three
    robots. They compete to score as many discs into their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen
    (15)-second match. The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the alliance receives.
    <br /><br />
    The match begins with a fifteen (15)-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver
    inputs. Discs scored during this period are worth extra points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots
    and try to maximize their alliance score by scoring as many goals as possible.
    <br /><br />
    The match ends with robots attempting to climb on pyramids located near the middle of the field. The robot earns
    points based on how high it climbs. Scoring for the match is summarized below.

    Rebound Rumble is played by two competing Alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each
    Alliance consists of three robots. They compete to score as many basketballs into their hoops
    as they can during a 2 minute and 15 second match. The higher the hoop in which the
    basketball is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.
    <br /><br />
    The match begins with a 15-second Hybrid Period in which robots operate independently of
    driver inputs. During this Hybrid Period, one robot on each Alliance may be controlled using a
    Microsoft Kinect. Baskets scored during this period are worth extra points. For the remainder of
    the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their Alliance score by scoring as many
    baskets as possible.
    <br /><br />
    The match ends with robots attempting to balance on bridges located at the middle of the field.
    In Qualification Matches, a robot from each Alliance will also try to balance on the white
    Coopertition™ bridge to score additional ranking points for each Alliance. Scoring for the match
    is summarized below.

  challenge: >
    LOGO MOTION incorporated the FIRST logo as game pieces. Each Alliance, comprised of three FIRST teams, must hang as many of the logo game pieces (inflated trianges, circles, and squares) on the scoring grids located on each end of the field as possible.
    <br /><br />
    The higher a game piece is hung on the grid, the more points the alliance receives.  Any logo piece hung on the same peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If the logo pieces are assembled in the order of the FIRST logo (triangle, circle, then square) the points for the row are doubled.
    <br /><br />
    Each match lasts for 2 minutes and 15 seconds, beginning with a 15-second “autonomous period” in which the robot functions on its own using instructions programmed by the team.  In order to receive extra points, it must hang Ubertubes.  Then it is time for the drivers to take control during the “teleoperated period” which lasts until the end of the game.
    <br /><br />
    At the end of the match, the robots deploy separate minibots which must race to the top of a vertical pole, triggering a sensor and earning the alliance additional bonus points.  The first minibot to reach the top receives 30 points and the remaining bots receive 20, 15, and 10 points for the last minibot.
